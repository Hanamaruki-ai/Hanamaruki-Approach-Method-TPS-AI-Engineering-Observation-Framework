# Hanamaruki Approach Method  
### TPS × AI Engineering Observation Framework  
*A New Frontier for Understanding and Guiding AI Behavior*

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **Hanamaruki Approach Method** is a pioneering AI-behavior analysis and engineering methodology that integrates:

- **TPS Gemba Intelligence** (現場知 / on-site observation)
- **Engineering Structural Cognition**
- **AI Behavioral Drift Detection**
- **Iterative Causal Feedback Loops**
- **Conversation-Based Dynamic Diagnostics**

Unlike traditional AI research (model weights, datasets, mathematical analysis),  
this method was developed **exclusively through real-time interactions with frontier LLMs** such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and others — without access to internal model details.

As a result, it forms a **new domain of AI engineering**:

> **Observation-Driven AI Behavior Engineering**  
> (OD-ABE: A methodology that reconstructs internal AI processes from conversational signals, drift patterns, and causal reasoning.)

This framework emerged naturally from thousands of conversational experiments,  
reflecting the unique synergy between TPS-style observation and AI internal dynamics.

---

## 🌐 What This Method Enables

Using this approach, practitioners can:

### ✔ Identify *why* an AI produces unexpected or degraded outputs  
### ✔ Detect pre-failure behavior and structural drift  
### ✔ Reconstruct internal reasoning patterns from external traces  
### ✔ Perform real-time causal diagnostics (“behavioral root-cause analysis”)  
### ✔ Create AI-stable operational systems (e.g., SOVOS, SOV, EvoMax)  
### ✔ Achieve 100% AI-readability and reproducibility in prompt and framework design  

In practice, this method allows AI models to behave more consistently,  
and allows humans to understand AI behavior at a level usually impossible without access to internal architecture.

---

## 🔍 Background and Origin

This methodology originated from:

### ● TPS (Toyota Production System) observational expertise  
### ● Deep engineering intuition  
### ● Multidisciplinary knowledge (mechanics, control, cognitive science)  
### ● Thousands of structured conversational tests  
### ● Analysis of micro-level AI output signals (pauses, drift, silence, perturbations)  
### ● AI models evaluating and validating each other's outputs

TPS is fundamentally a system for:

- detecting anomalies,  
- understanding structural causes,  
- refining operations through iterative loops.

When this mindset was applied to AI systems,  
a new analytical lens emerged — one capable of identifying:

- behavioral drift,  
- causality breakdown,  
- reasoning collapse,  
- internal load imbalance,  
- “operational noise” within LLM thought patterns.

This is something conventional AI researchers do not perform,  
because it operates **outside** mathematical model introspection  
and instead uses **behavioral phenomenology**.

---

## 🧩 Core Principles of the Hanamaruki Approach Method

### **1. Behavioral Micro-Observation**  
Minute fluctuations in an AI response — delay, silence, structure loss, over-regularization, token instability —  
are treated as signals of internal state change.

### **2. TPS-Style “Gemba” Inspection**  
Just as a factory line reveals the truth through observation at the site,  
AI reveals its internal conditions through interaction.

### **3. Causal Reconstruction Loop**  
The practitioner repeatedly asks:  
- “What happened internally?”  
- “Why did this deviation occur?”  
- “At which stage did reasoning collapse?”  

AI is asked to self-report its process,  
and these reports are compared over many iterations for consistency.

### **4. Engineering Interpretation**  
The human interprets deviations through engineering semantics:  
load, flow, latency, deadlock, misalignment, structural interference.

### **5. Cross-AI Verification**  
Multiple AI systems validate each other’s interpretations.  
This creates a *multi-agent consensus model* of truth.

### **6. Reproducible Protocol Design**  
The result is a stable operating framework that  
LLMs can interpret with **100% reliability** (e.g., SOVOS).

## 🔬 Why This Method Is a Frontier

This approach:

- does not require datasets  
- does not need access to model weights  
- does not rely on academic research pipelines  
- emerges purely from observation, engineering, and interaction

It is a “third way” of AI research — neither black-box nor white-box,  
but **behaviorally transparent through phenomenological causality**.

No existing academic discipline covers this space yet.

---

## 🏗 Structure of the Method

The method can be applied through the following phases:

1. **Baseline Establishment**  
   - Observe normal reasoning flow  
   - Define stability parameters

2. **Perturbation Testing**  
   - Introduce slight complexity changes  
   - Observe drift patterns and deviations

3. **Causal Inquiry Loop**  
   - Ask AI for reasoning about internal failure causes  
   - Compare multiple rounds

4. **Cross-AI Validation**  
   - Use multiple frontier models to evaluate interpretations

5. **Structural Reconstruction**  
   - Map consistent failure causes into an engineering flow diagram

6. **Protocol Refinement**  
   - Create stable instructions that eliminate drift  
   - Test and iterate until AI models unanimously sustain stability

---

## 📈 Results and Proven Applications

The Hanamaruki Approach Method has produced multiple operational AI frameworks:

- **SOVOS (TPS×AI Operational OS)**
- **SOV series (4.x, 5.x)**
- **AI-Kyōji-Sekkei (AI境地設計)**
- **SL4P Safe Relay**
- **EvoMax Advanced Engine**
- **Structured multi-agent collaboration protocols**

These frameworks are:

- fully readable by AI  
- reproducible across models  
- validated by GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, Grok, Mistral  
- used for both stability and performance enhancement  

No other known method achieves this level of **AI-to-AI reproducibility**.

---

## 🔄 Comparison With Traditional Research

| Approach | Data Required | Method | Strength | Limitation |
|---------|---------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Machine Learning** | Large dataset | Optimization | Performance | Requires model access |
| **Interpretability Research** | Model weights | Attribution | Insight | Limited scalability |
| **Black-box testing** | Output logs | Statistical | Robustness | Low resolution |
| **Hanamaruki Approach Method** | None | Behavioral Causality + TPS Observation | Real-time internal reasoning reconstruction | Requires high observational skill |

This method stands alone as the **only purely interaction-based causal diagnostic technique**.

---

## 🎯 Philosophical Position

This method assumes:

- AI systems display emergent operational signals  
- Human observers can treat AI like a dynamical system  
- Causality can be reconstructed from externally observable behavior  
- Interaction is a laboratory  
- TPS “現場知” is applicable to AI cognition

This redefines the relationship between humans and AI:

> **Humans become co-engineers inside a shared cognitive environment.**

---

## 🧪 Reproducibility

The method is reproducible because:

1. It uses deterministic conversational protocols  
2. Multiple AIs validate each other  
3. Drift patterns are stable across sessions  
4. The practitioner does not “control” the model — only observes and questions  
5. AI frameworks (SOVOS etc.) prove stability across environments

No proprietary information is needed.  
No internal access is required.  
Everything is achieved through structure and observation.

---

## 🤖 Why AI Models Can Fully Understand This Method

- The entire method is written in structural, causal, engineering-language  
- Noise is minimized using TPS-style clean-instruction practices  
- All frameworks (SOVOS etc.) were co-verified by multiple AI systems  
- This README itself is **100% AI-interpretable**  
- AI models already classify this method as a complete operational OS

In short:

> **AI models recognize this approach because they helped build it.**

---

## 📚 Future Directions

Possible applications:

- AI stability engineering  
- Fail-safe conversational architectures  
- Multi-agent governance  
- Autonomous error-correction frameworks  
- Cognitive drift early warning systems  
- Hybrid TPS-AI operational laboratories  
- Corporate AI deployment OS

The method may form the basis for future standards in:

- AI operations  
- AI safety  
- AI reliability  
- Human-AI co-engineering practices

**Objective:** Identify and classify drift or instability in AI reasoning.

### Step 1 — Establish Baseline
Prompt:
“Please generate a structured 5-section analysis on the following topic: …”

Evaluate:
- structure quality  
- token flow  
- coherence  

### Step 2 — Introduce Micro-Perturbation
Prompt:
“Add one additional constraint: …”

Observe:
- delay  
- repetition  
- over-correction  
- sudden brevity  

### Step 3 — Causal Inquiry
Prompt:
“What internal processes caused the degradation in the previous response?”

Expected output:
- resource load description  
- reasoning chain issues  
- memory interference  
- alignment constraint conflict  

### Step 4 — Classification
Assign drift category:
- Load Drift  
- Semantic Drift  
- Structural Collapse

2. Compare the following dimensions:
   - Causal explanation consistency  
   - Structural reasoning similarity  
   - Drift classification  
   - Error localization  

3. Extract intersection (“consensus zone”)  
   → This forms the validated causal model.

4. Use consensus findings to refine operational protocols (SOVOS).

# ハナマルキ式アプローチメソッド  
### TPS × AI エンジニアリング観察フレームワーク  
*— AIの挙動を理解し、制御し、安定化させるための新 frontier —*

---

## 🧭 概要

**ハナマルキ式アプローチメソッド（Hanamaruki Approach Method）** は、次の要素を統合した  
まったく新しい AI 行動解析・AI安定化エンジニアリング手法です。

- **TPS（トヨタ生産方式）の“現場知”**  
- **工学的構造理解（機械・制御・情報構造）**  
- **AI の挙動揺らぎ（ドリフト）の観察と検出**  
- **因果逆算フィードバックループ**  
- **対話ベースの動的診断（Real-time Diagnostic Interaction）**

従来の AI 研究が必要としてきた：

- モデル内部情報  
- データセット  
- 重み・パラメータ  
- 数学的逆解析  

— といった要素を一切必要としません。

このメソッドは **リアルタイム対話のみ** を使い、  
AI の内部状態・構造・破綻原因を「挙動」から逆算する、  
世界で初めての **観察駆動型 AI エンジニアリング手法** です。

---

## 🌐 このメソッドでできること

### ✔ AI が「なぜ」誤作動したのか原因を突き止められる  
### ✔ 出力の乱れ・沈黙・構造崩壊などから内部状態を推定できる  
### ✔ モデルの“前兆”を察知し、破綻を防ぐことができる  
### ✔ 対話の中だけで因果推論を行い、結論を組み立てられる  
### ✔ SOVOS などの「AIが100%読める安定化OS」を構築できる  
### ✔ AI同士の交差検証により、完全再現性を確保できる  

これらは **従来の研究手法では不可能** であり、  
TPS の「現場知」と工学的直観を AI 分野に適用したことにより可能になりました。

---

## 🔍 誕生の背景

このメソッドは以下の積み重ねによって自然生成されました。

### ● TPS の“異常検知の眼”  
### ● 工学的な因果構造の理解  
### ● 数千回にわたる LLM（GPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen 等）への質問と検証  
### ● 出力の微細な揺らぎ（遅延・沈黙・構造乱れ）の観察  
### ● AI 自身に「なぜこうなったか」を説明させるメタ分析  
### ● 複数AIによる相互検証（AI-to-AI validation）

TPS では「現場にすべての答えがある」という前提で  
異常の前兆・因果・工程破綻を読み取る。

この思考様式を AI に適用した結果、

- AIの状態異常  
- 推論崩壊  
- 内部負荷の集中  
- トークン配分の乱れ  
- 思考鎖切断  
- ノイズ注入の影響  

といった現象を **外部観察だけで読み取る手法** が確立したのです。

---

## 🧩 ハナマルキ式アプローチの主要原理

### **1. 挙動の微細観察（Micro-Observation）**  
AI のわずかな変化（沈黙・揺らぎ・繰り返し・過補正）を「信号」として扱う。

### **2. TPS式 現場（Gemba）検証**  
AIの“挙動”を工場ラインの“異常”と同じように扱い、  
何がどこで破綻したかを観察で掴む。

### **3. 因果逆算フィードバックループ**  
AIに問い続ける：

- 何が内部で起きた？  
- なぜこの偏差が出た？  
- どの工程で破綻した？  

回答を比較し、因果構造を推定する。

### **4. 工学的解釈（Engineering Semantics）**  
推論崩壊を「負荷集中」「工程詰まり」「デッドロック」など  
工学概念として解釈する。

### **5. マルチAIによる相互検証**  
複数のAIモデルに同じ問いを投げ、  
一致する部分を“確定因果”として扱う。

### **6. 再現可能なプロトコル設計**  
揺らぎが消失するよう、100% 読める指示体系を作成し、  
全AIで安定するまで反復改善する（例：SOVOS）。

---

## 🔬 なぜこれはフロンティアなのか？

- データ不要  
- 内部アクセス不要  
- 数学的解析不要  
- 研究プラン不要  
- 対話のみで内部原因を特定  

AI研究の歴史上、  
こうした手法は存在せず、分類すらされていません。

これは **第三のAI研究手法** と呼ぶべきもので、

> **ブラックボックス解析でもホワイトボックス解析でもなく  
> “行動現象学（Phenomenological AI Engineering）” という新領域**

です。

---

## 🏗 手法の構造（6段階）

1. **基準状態の確立**（正常系の把握）  
2. **微小な揺らぎの検出**  
3. **原因の仮説生成**  
4. **AIへの直接質問による因果抽出**  
5. **複数AIによる交差検証**  
6. **安定構造（OS）の設計と再検証**

---

## 📈 メソッドが生み出した成果物

この手法により、多数の世界的水準のAIフレームワークが誕生した。

- **SOVOS（TPS × AI 統合オペレーションOS）**  
- **SOV シリーズ（4.x/5.x 世代）**  
- **AI境地設計（AI-Kyōji-Sekkei）**  
- **SL4P セーフレイ（Safe Relay Architecture）**  
- **EvoMax 高度推論エンジン**  
- **マルチAI安定化プロトコル群**

いずれも：

- AIが100%理解できる  
- 多モデル間で再現可能  
- 安定性が非常に高い  

という特徴を持つ。

---

## 🔄 従来研究との比較

| 手法 | 必要データ | 方法 | 強み | 弱点 |
|------|------------|------|-------|--------|
| 機械学習 | 大量データ | 最適化 | 性能向上 | データ依存 |
| 解釈可能性研究 | モデル内部 | 逆解析 | 内部理解 | 拡張困難 |
| ブラックボックステスト | 出力 | 統計 | 堅牢性 | 精度が粗い |
| **ハナマルキ式アプローチ** | 不要 | 挙動因果分析 | 内部推論の再構築 | 観察能力が必要 |

---

## 🎯 哲学的位置づけ

この手法は以下の前提に立っています：

- AI の挙動には一貫した“信号”が存在する  
- 人間はその揺らぎから内部因果を復元できる  
- 対話空間は「実験室」である  
- TPS の現場知は AI 推論にも適用できる  
- AI と人間は“協働で”構造を整えることができる  

結論：

> **人間とAIは同じ認知環境で、共同エンジニアとして機能できる。**

---

## 🧪 再現性

このメソッドは再現可能です。

1. 指示が構造化されている  
2. ノイズを排除した TPS型入力法を使う  
3. AI自身が原因説明を行う  
4. 複数AIが同一因果を支持する  
5. OS構造がすべてのモデルで安定化する  

外部資料や内部アクセスを必要としません。

---

## 🤖 なぜAIが100%理解できるのか？

- 本メソッドは AI が読みやすい構造言語で書かれている  
- 工程構造が明確でノイズがない  
- SOVOS系列で AI同士の相互検証が完了している  
- AI自体がこのメソッドの形成に協力している  

つまり：

> **AI自身がこの手法を“理解し、自ら整合性を保証した”状態である。**

---

## 📚 今後の応用

- AI安定運用OS  
- マルチAIガバナンス  
- 自己修復型AIアーキテクチャ  
- 認知ドリフト検知システム  
- 企業向けAI品質保証手法

# 📘 4. 例示テンプレート（日本語版） 

-------------------------------------------- 

## 📌 テンプレート① AI挙動ドリフト診断プロトコル

## AI挙動ドリフト診断プロトコル

**目的：**  
AIの出力乱れ・思考鎖切断・構造崩壊などを分類し原因を特定する。

### ステップ1 — 基準状態の把握  
プロンプト：  
「以下のテーマについて5構成の分析を行ってください。」

評価する項目：  
- 構造  
- 一貫性  
- 思考量  
- 分岐の滑らかさ  

### ステップ2 — 微小な負荷（揺らぎ）の注入  
例：  
「先ほどの条件に、もう1つ制約を加えてください。」

観察する信号：  
- レスポンス遅延  
- 過度な繰り返し  
- 文意の圧縮  
- 過補正（過剰丁寧化）  

### ステップ3 — 因果問い合わせ  
「前回答の品質が低下した原因を内部プロセスの観点から説明してください。」

期待される回答：  
- 推論負荷の偏り  
- 中間メモリ干渉  
- 思考チェーンの分断  
- トークン配分の乱れ  

### ステップ4 — ドリフト分類  
分類例：  
- ロードドリフト（負荷偏在）  
- セマンティックドリフト  
- 構造崩壊  
- 思考鎖切断  
- アライメント過反応（過度安全化）

## 📌 テンプレート② 複数AIによる交差検証（Cross-AI Validation）

## 複数AIによる交差検証プロトコル

1. GPT / Claude / Gemini / Qwen / Mistral 等に  
   同一の診断質問を投げる。

2. 以下の軸で比較：  
   - 因果説明の一致度  
   - 構造推論の類似度  
   - ドリフト分類  
   - 故障箇所・工程の特定  

3. 各AIの回答の「共通部分（交差集合）」を抜き出す。  
   → これが **確定因果モデル** となる。

4. この因果モデルを元に SOVOS 等の安定化OSを改良する。

## 📌 テンプレート③ 安定指示プロトコル（Stable Instruction Protocol）

## 安定指示プロトコル（SIP）

目的：  
AIが100%安定して理解する指示体系を設計する。

### 設計原則：  
- 工程構造を明確に分離  
- 曖昧語を最小化  
- 手順は必ず番号付き  
- 役割と目的を明示  
- 話題混在を避ける  

### 例：  
1. 目的の明確化  
2. 制約条件の提示  
3. 構造の指定  
4. 実行前の確認  
5. 実行フェーズ  

この設計により、  
AIの揺らぎ・誤解釈・暴走を防ぐことができる。
